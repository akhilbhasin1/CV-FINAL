# Pedestrian Detection at Stoplights
When crossing roads and driving vehicles, staying alert for any surrounding movements and being attentive to road signs and stop lights is of the essence. It is important to detect different components when it comes to intersections (crosswalks and stop lights) to ensure everyoneâ€™s safety. This project will focus on detecting pedestrians from a video.
